          <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, 
            driven by the curiosity to understand how technology works behind the screens. 
            Since discovering the world of programming, I began to see every problem as an opportunity to create something useful and beautiful.
            Today, I am mainly dedicated to web development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to turn ideas into fast, responsive, and user-friendly pages.
            I have already built academic and personal projects that challenged me to combine logic and design, and every line of code I write is another step forward on this journey.
            <br />
            My goal is simple: to keep learning, exploring new technologies, and creating digital solutions that truly make sense for people.
